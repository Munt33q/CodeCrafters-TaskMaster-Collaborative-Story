# TaskMaster Project

This repository is maintained by Team CodeCrafters for CSC 317 (Fall 2025).  
TaskMaster is a collaborative project designed to simulate a task management system.  
Each team member will contribute new "features" (chapters) to the project using GitHub branches, pull requests, and merges.  

It was the beginning of a new project. The team sat down, ready to design a tool that would help manage tasks and organize projects.  
A blinking cursor on the screen waited for the first feature to be written.
